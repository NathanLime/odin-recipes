        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> Well-Fermented Kimchi (chopped into small pieces)</li>
            <li><strong>1/3 cup</strong> Kimchi Brine (the juice from the kimchi)</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> All-Purpose Flour (or Korean pancake mix)</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> Potato Starch or Cornstarch (for crispiness)</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> Cold Water (or club soda for extra crispiness)</li>
            <li><strong>1/2</strong> Onion (thinly sliced)</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> Green Onions (sliced)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> Sugar (to balance sourness)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> Gochugaru (optional, for extra color/spice)</li>
            <li>Neutral Oil (Canola, Vegetable, or Rice Bran oil, for frying)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional Dipping Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 tbsp</strong> Soy Sauce, <strong>1 tbsp</strong> Vinegar, <strong>1 tsp</strong> Sugar, <strong>1 tsp</strong> Water</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Mix Dry Batter:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, potato starch, sugar, and Gochugaru (if using).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add Wet Ingredients:</strong> Add the cold water and kimchi brine to the dry mixture. Mix gently until just combined (some lumps are fine; do not overmix, as this develops gluten and makes the pancake chewy, not crispy).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fold in Fillings:</strong> Fold in the chopped kimchi, sliced onion, and sliced green onions. The batter should be slightly thick but still pourable, with the kimchi and vegetables evenly coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fry the Pancake:</strong> Heat a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Add a generous amount of oil (about 2-3 tablespoons) and swirl to coat the pan. Pour about 1/3 of the batter into the hot oil and spread it into a thin, even circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook Until Crispy:</strong> Cook for 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and crispy, and the edges pull away easily. Add a little more oil around the edges, then flip. Press down gently with a spatula to ensure even crispiness. Cook the second side for another 3-4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Slice and Serve:</strong> Transfer the pancake to a cutting board, slice into wedges, and serve immediately with the dipping sauce on the side.
            </li>
        </ol>
