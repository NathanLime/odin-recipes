    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kimchi stew is one of the most-loved of all the stews in Korean cuisine. It’s a warm, hearty, spicy, savory, delicious dish that pretty much everyone loves. As long as they can handle spicy food, I never met a person who didn’t like kimchi-jjigae.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound kimchi, cut into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup kimchi brine</li>
        <li>½ pound pork shoulder (or pork belly)</li>
        <li>½ package of tofu (optional), sliced into ½ inch thick bite size pieces</li>
        <li>3 green onions</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced (1 cup)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean hot pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gochujang (hot pepper paste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cups of anchovy stock (or chicken or beef broth)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Base Ingredients:</strong> Ensure all ingredients are chopped and sliced as directed. Have the broth ready and keep the kimchi brine separate.
        </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Sauté Meat and Kimchi:</strong> Heat the pot over medium heat (add a little sesame oil if the pork belly isn't fatty). Cook the pork until the fat renders. Add the chopped kimchi, onions, and garlic. Stir in the Gochugaru, Gochujang, and sugar. Sauté for 3-5 minutes to build a deep flavor base.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simmer the Stew:</strong> Pour in the broth/water and the reserved kimchi brine. Bring the stew to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover the pot and simmer for 15 to 25 minutes, allowing the flavors to fully meld.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Finish and Serve:</strong> Gently place the tofu slices on top of the simmering stew. Cook for about 5 more minutes until the tofu is heated through. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning (add salt, soy sauce, or fish sauce for depth, or a pinch more sugar if too sour). Turn off the heat, garnish with sliced green onions, and serve immediately with hot steamed rice.
